Introduction to basic literals: string and int

explain variables of those types

cover some basic string and numeric operations

Numeric

```
a=1
print (a)
a=10
print(a)
b = a
print(b)
```

Mathematical Operations

```
a=10+7
print (a)
a=10-7
print (a)
a=10/5
print (a)
a=10*5
print (a)
a=10%5
print (a)
```

String operations

```
s="a"
t="p"
p=s+t
p=s*5

```

Conversions

```
c=10
print(c+10)
d=str(c)
print(d+10)
print(d+"text")
f="45"
print(f+10)
g=int(f)
print(g+10)
```

# Problems

1. WAPT print answer of 5+10+15

1. WAPT print add 10 and 5 and then divide the result by 3

2. WAPT print the remainder of 25 divided by 7

1. WAPT print the word "carpool" when there are two strings available a="car" and b="pool"

1. WAPT make the following pattern from the string "tom"

```
  tom
 tomtom
tomtomtom
```
